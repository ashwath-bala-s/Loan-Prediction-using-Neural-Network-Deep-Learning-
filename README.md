# Loan Prediction using Neural Network

**Introduction:**

Accurate loan prediction is essential for financial institutions to manage risk and ensure a healthy lending portfolio. By assessing the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant data, banks can make informed decisions and improve their loan processing efficiency.This project aims to leverage neural networks, a powerful deep learning technique, to predict loan approvals based on various applicant features such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop a neural network model that predicts the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on their demographic, financial, and credit-related information. By analyzing features such as applicant income, employment history, credit score, loan amount, and other relevant attributes, the model will learn to identify patterns and factors that influence loan approval decisions. 

**Dataset:** 

The Dataset used for this project has 614 records and has the following variables:

Loan_ID: A unique identifier for each loan.

Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female).

Married: Marital status of the applicant

Dependents: Number of dependents of the applicant 

Education: Education level of the applicant 

Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed 

ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.

CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant.

LoanAmount: Amount requested for loan

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.

Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines (

Property_Area: Area of property

Loan_Status: Loan approval status (target variable).

**Project Description:**

**Functional API:**

• Developed and compiled deep learning model by defining loss function and optimizer for the Loan Prediction dataset.
